</div>

Renders JSX components to HTML on the server and in the browser.

## Installation

This is a [Node.js][node] module available through the [npm][npm] registry. Before installing, download and install Node.js. Node.js 6 or higher is required.

Installation is done using the [npm install][install] command:

```sh
$ npm install -S hyperons
```

[node]: https://nodejs.org/en/
[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com/
[install]: https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally

## Features

* Share code between your React single-page apps and plain HTML pages
* Render your components on the server and in the browser
* Very small code size (1.25kb gzipped)
* Support for CSS stringification, boolean attributes, void elements, fragments, and more
* Render class components or stateless functional components

## Usage

This module provides two functions; `h()` and `render()`. If you've worked with [React][react] before then `h()` can be considered equivalent to `React.createElement()` and `render()` equivalent to `ReactDOM.render()` in the browser or `ReactDOM.renderToString()` on the server.

The example below shows how to render a simple component using Hyperons with vanilla JS syntax:

[react]: https://reactjs.org/

```js
import { h, render } from 'hyperons'

const welcome = () => (
  h('div', { class: 'welcome-banner' },
    h('h1', null, 'Hello World!'),
    h('p', null, 'This component was rendered with Hyperons'))
)

render(welcome())
```

Although you can use Hyperons without any complex build pipelines or compilation steps, I'd recommend using [JSX](#jsx) to more succinctly describe your markup. Here is the same component as before but rewritten to use JSX syntax:

```jsx
import { h, render } from 'hyperons'

const Welcome = () => (
  <div class="welcome-banner">
    <h1>Hyperons</h1>
    <p>This component was rendered with Hyperons</p>
  </div>
)

render(<Welcome />)
```

## API

### `h(element[, properties][, ...children])`

The `h()` function accepts the following arguments:

* `element` This can be the name of a HTML element, or a function or a class
* `properties` An optional object of HTML element attributes. See the [properties documentation](#properties) for more information.
* `...children` An optional number of child elements. See the [children documentation](#children) for more information.

This method returns the HTML output wrapped in an object marking it as as safe.

### `render(safeString)`

The `render()` function converts the wrapped output of the `h()` method into a regular string.

## Syntax

### Properties

Properties are declared as an object containing [HTML attributes][attrs] and values. Attribute names may be written in camelCase or in lowercase. For example, the attribute `tabindex` may be written as `tabIndex`. Any HTML attributes written in camelCase will be converted to lowercase but they will not be hyphenated. Attributes requiring hyphens, such as `aria-*` and `data-*`, should be written with hyphens.

Since `class` and `for` are [reserved words][words] in JavaScript you may use the aliases `className` and `htmlFor` instead.

Boolean attributes, such as `hidden` or `checked`, will only be rendered if assigned a [truthy][truthy] value. Enumerated attributes which accept the values `"true"` or `"false"`, such as `contenteditable`, will be rendered with their assigned value.

Any framework specific properties such as `key` and `ref` will not be rendered. Any attributes with a function value will be ignored.

[attrs]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes
[words]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#Keywords
[truthy]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy

### Styles

The `style` attribute accepts a JavaScript object containing CSS properties and values.

Style properties may be written in camelCase in order to be consistent with accessing the properties on DOM nodes from JS (e.g. `element.style.marginBottom`). Vendor prefixes other than "ms" should begin with a capital letter. This is why `WebkitHyphens` has an uppercase "W".

Hyperons will automatically append a `px` suffix to numbers, but certain properties will remain unitless (e.g. `z-index` or `order`). If you want to use units other than `px`, you should specify the value as a string with the desired unit. For example:

```jsx
// Input:
const styles = {
  display: 'flex',
  order: 2,
  width: '50%',
  marginBottom: 20,
  WebkitHyphens: 'auto',
}

<div style={styles}></div>

// Output:
<div style="display:flex;order:2;width:50%;margin-bottom:20px;-webkit-hyphens:auto;></div>
```

### HTML entities

Hyperons will escape all strings. This means that if you need to display a HTML entity, you will run into double escaping issues. There are various ways to work-around this issue; the easiest of which is to write the unicode character directly in your code (and your source file uses UTF-8 encoding). Otherwise, you can find the [unicode number][charcode] for the required character. For example:

```jsx
// Incorrect. Outputs: <h1>Mac &amp;amp; Cheese</h1>
<h1>Mac &amp; Cheese</h1>
// Correct. Outputs: <h1>Mac &amp; Cheese</h1>
<h1>Mac & Cheese</h1>
// Correct. Outputs: <h1>Mac &amp; Cheese</h1>
<h1>{`Mac ${String.fromCharCode(38)} Cheese`}</h1>
```

[charcode]: https://www.fileformat.info/info/charset/UTF-8/list.htm

### Children

Components may render any number of child elements. Children can be strings, other components, or a combination of both.

Functions provided to the first argument of Hyperons will have any children appended as an extra `children` property. This functionality allows you to re-use and compose components in useful ways.

Please note that child elements will not be rendered for [void elements][void].

```jsx
const Container = ({ children }) => <p>{children}</p>
const html = <Container>{'Hello'}</Container> // Outputs: <p>Hello</p>
```

[void]: https://www.w3.org/TR/html/syntax.html#void-elements

### Class components

When using other frameworks such as React, class components may be used to create components which maintain state or add extra functionality using methods. Hyperons renders static HTML so there is no state and there are no component lifecycle methods. But if you need to author or render a class component Hyperons does provide a base `Component` which may be extended.

```jsx
import { h, Component } from 'hyperons'

class MyComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```

### Fragments

In React and React-like frameworks components must always return a single enclosing element. But sometimes it is convenient or required to return a list of elements, either because you don't need the extra elements or the extra elements would create invalid HTML output. For example, when rendering a description list the title and detail (`<dt>` and `<dd>`) elements are usually grouped in pairs:

```jsx
import { h } from 'hyperons'

function DescriptionList(props) {
  return (
    <dl>
      {props.definitions.map((item) => (
        <dt>{item.title}</dt>
        <dd>{item.description}</dd>
      ))}
    </dl>
  )
}
```

However, most tools will throw an error when evaluating the above code. The description title and detail elements should be wrapped in an enclosing element, but that would result in invalid HTML.

To solve this [React 16.2][react-16] introduced the concept of [fragments][fragments]. Fragments allow you to wrap a list of elements without adding extra elements to the DOM. To use fragments in your JSX code Hyperons includes a `Fragment` component:

```jsx
import { h, Fragment } from 'hyperons'

function DescriptionList(props) {
  return (
    <dl>
      {props.definitions.map((item) => (
        <Fragment>
          <dt>{item.title}</dt>
          <dd>{item.description}</dd>
        </Fragment>
      ))}
    </dl>
  )
}
```

[fragments]: https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html

### Inner HTML

Hyperons supports the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` property to inject unescaped HTML code. This is potentially dangerous and should never be used around any user input, but it can be useful as a last resort.

```jsx
const html = { __html: '<i>Mac &amp; Cheese</i>' }
<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={html}></div> // Outputs: <div><i>Mac &amp; Cheese</i></div>
```

### JSX

_Not familiar with JSX? Check out [WTF is JSX][wtf] and [JSX in Depth][in-depth] first._

If you're authoring your components with JSX syntax you will need to transpile your code into plain JavaScript in order to run them. Depending on the toolchain you're using there will be different plugins available. Some popular tools to transpile JavaScript are [Babel][babel] (with [the JSX plugin][babel-jsx]) and [Bubl√©][buble] (with [JSX enabled][buble-jsx]).

Whichever tool you use, you will need to specify the JSX _pragma_ for the transpiler to target. The pragma is the name of the variable you assign Hyperons to. For example, in the code below the pragma is `h`:

### Name

> In particle physics, a hyperon is any baryon containing one or more strange quarks, but no charm

‚Äî [Wikipedia](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperon)

In keeping with React and the wider ecosystem I wanted to give this project a science-related name but also something that implies being small and light. Thus, Hyperons.

### Prior art

This module was inspired by the [vhtml][vhtml] package and also borrows from a few other JSX to string implementations:

* [Hyperapp Render][hyperapp] (style stringification)
* [React DOM][react-dom] (boolean attributes)
